Stevenson **",
  "body_paragraphs": [
    "Parsons stands convicted of Aggravated Assault, contrary to s 268. # Background",
    "The two offences occurred on an LRT platform in Calgary in the early morning hours. Involved were the victim, and four adult males, one of whom was Parsons.",
    "It was a random attack, and the victim was not known to any of the males.",
    "A video was shown at the sentencing hearing, and it displayed the four men \"stalking\" the victim, with the victim finally cornered by the men against a wall on the platform.",
    "One of the men (not the accused) stabbed the victim six times. While none of the stab wounds were life-threatening, the victim was required to spend three days in the hospital.",
    "Ms. Parhar, Counsel for the Crown, submits that it was only due to \"sheer luck\" that the stabbing did not result in a far greater risk to the victim's life.",
    "In addition to the stabbing by one of the four, the accused grabbed a can of bear spray from the victim and sprayed her with it.",
    "Parsons is indigenous, with First Nation status, affiliated with the Ochapowace Nation. # Sentencing Materials",
    "The Court ordered and received a **_Gladue_** Report, prepared pursuant to s 718.2(e) and was referred to the following precedents by Ms. Parhar: \u2022 **_R v Bandesha_** , 2013 ABCA 255 \u2022 **_R v Ross_** , 2013 ABQB 274 \u2022 **_R v Ledesma_** , 2012 ABPC 10 \u2022 **_R v Ellwood_** , 2013 ABPC 148 \u2022 **_R v Morriseau_** , 2010 ABPC 404",
    "Defence Counsel Sanchit Dhawan referred me to the following two precedents: \u2022 **_R v Callihoo_** , 2017 ABPC 40 \u2022 **_R v Paquette_** , 2020 ABPC 173",
    "I have also had reference to a paper prepared by Amy Matychuk in July of 2018 entitled \"Indigenous Sentencing Principles\", and the attached list of 14 sentencing decisions.",
    "The **_Gladue_** Report reveals that Parsons' upbringing was, as is often the case with young indigenous youth, extremely dysfunctional, and alcoholism and domestic violence characterized the environment in which he was raised.",
    "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, chaired by the late Justice and Senator Murray Sinclair, as did the Supreme Court in **_Gladue_** , **_Wells_** , **_Ipilee_** , and many decisions following, observed that such environments often flowed from residential school's experience of the parents and grandparents on the paternal side or maternal side or both.",
    "One of the serious results of many of the residential school experiences is that generations of indigenous parents lacked any parental skills normally provided in other segments of society.",
    "Also, coupled with the paternal strategies adopted by the federal government, and the outdated _Indian Act_ , the capitalistic initiative mindset that is prevalent in those other segments is often - but not always - found in the indigenous segment of Canadian society.",
    "The above commentary is not based on any research - it is simply my opinion.",
    "Regardless, the involvement of indigenous offenders and the sentencing of indigenous offenders has to be considered in light of the aforesaid section 718.2(e) and the legal precedents referred by counsel.",
    "I also bear in mind the provisions of sections 718, 718.1, and 718.2 of the _Criminal Code_ , and in particular the mandatory consideration set out in s.718.2(e): \"A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles: (e) all available sanctions, other than imprisonment, that are reasonable in the circumstances and consistent with the harm done to victims or to the community should be considered for all offenders, _with particular attention to the circumstances of Aboriginal offenders_(emphasis mine). (It seems that the description of offenders as \"Aboriginal\" hasn't caught up to the more modern description as \"Indigenous\". # Background of the accused",
    "The accused's paternal grandparents both attend residential school. # Sentencing Positions",
    "The Crown seeks a sentence of 3-4 years in a federal penitentiary, but submits that it should be closer to 3 years.",
    "The Defence seeks a sentence of time spent in pre-trial custody, followed by 24 months of probation. # Analysis:",
    "In **__Bandesha__** (supra) the accused was convicted of assault causing bodily harm. The offence was committed by a group. The sentence appealed from was a conditional discharge.",
    "The Alberta Court of Appeal allowed the Crown's appeal and imposed a sentence of 90 days, less 6 days of pre-trial custody.",
    "In the decision, at paragraphs 19 and 20 the Court States: \"[19] One important aspect of that seriousness is how many people take part. Most assaults are by a single person. However, where they are by a group, the assault is more serious. For example, a series of concerted individual assaults: **_R v Liron and MacIntyre_**(1992) 1992 ABCA 319 (CanLII), 135 AR 166 (CA). The present case was worse, as it was a concerted simultaneous assault by four people. So that calls for a higher sentence, (On group cooperation in a crime of **_R v Hennessey_** , _supra_.) [20] The rationale for all this is explained well in Ashworth, _Sentencing and Criminal Justice_ 163-64 (5th ed 2010). A victim ordinarily has no chance of escaping or vanquishing four attackers. The potential result is very serious, and the whole thing must be terrifying for the victim.\"",
    "There can be no question that the victim in the matter before me must surely have been terrified by the conduct of the four attackers, including the accused. # Sentence",
    "I sentence the accused to 42 months in a federal penitentiary, less the period spent in pre-trial custody. On November 21, 2024, the date of the sentencing hearing, the accused had spent 394 days in custody.",
    "Adding the 15 days since the sentencing hearing to today, the accused should be credited with a total of 409 days. On an enhanced basis of crediting one and a half day for every actual day, the accused is entitled to 613.5 days credit (approximately 20 months) so he will have approximately 22 months left to serve.",
    "There will be no victim surcharge, but I impose the following ancillary orders: 1) He is to supply a sample of his DNA for registration in the national DNA Data Bank, pursuant to s 487.04(x) of the _Criminal Code_ ; 2) Pursuant to s 109, I impose a weapons Prohibition Order for life. Delivered orally on the 6th day of December, 2024. Dated at the City of Calgary, Alberta this 18th day of December, 2024. | B.C. Stevenson A Justice of the Alberta Court of Justice ---|--- **Appearances:** Michelle Parhar for the Crown Sanchit Dhawan for the Accused"
